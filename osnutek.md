<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Since chess got popular in last few years, we decided make a Chess DataBase with games of players,
  which is going to help new players (also the expirienced ones) find out what are the most popular 
  openings in chess. We are also going to find out what are the highest rated turnaments and 
  which players are the best. 
</p>
<p>
  To make it more interesting, we will make a playable chess board where user can play chess and when comes he to
  a certain position he can look in our DataBase and get the information about that position.
  For example, the user will be able to see what are the most popular moves in that position, who played them
  and what was the outcome of the games.

Data will consist of turnament they played at and name of opening played.
Games will be presented in standard chess notation where numbers will present the ordinal number of move,
and after that 2 moves played, first one by white and second one by black. At the end of the game will be 
the result of the game presented as 1-0 if white won, 0-1 if black won or 1/2-1/2 if there was a draw.
