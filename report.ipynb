    "The project involves building a neural network-based AI that plays chess, with the goal of mimicking the playing style of Magnus Carlsen. The AI is trained on data extracted from games played by Magnus Carlsen, with the evaluation of positions performed by the Stockfish chess engine. The project uses TensorFlow for training the neural networks and employs a phased approach, training separate models for different stages of the game: opening, postopening, middlegame, postmiddlegame, and endgame.unctions."

    "<b>Data Preparation</b> <br>\n",
    "The data used for training the models is sourced from a PGN (Portable Game Notation) file containing games played by Magnus Carlsen. The parse_pgn function reads the PGN file and extracts chess positions (in FEN format) and their evaluations from Stockfish. Each position is annotated with the corresponding phase of the game and the best move. This information is saved in a CSV file for further use. The phases are determined based on the ply count (half-moves) of the game, with each phase representing a specific segment of a game.  "

    "The project involves training five separate models, each corresponding to a different phase of the game. This phased approach is employed because the nature of the game changes significantly from the opening to the endgame, and a single model might not effectively capture the nuances of each phase. For each phase, the dataset is split into training and validation sets, and a neural network model is built and trained using these sets. The models are relatively simple, consisting of a flattening layer followed by dense layers with ReLU activation functions. This can be changed for better results but \n",

    "The relationship between age and performance in chess has long intrigued enthusiasts and researchers alike. One of the most prominent metrics for evaluating a player's skill level in chess is the Elo rating system, developed by Arpad Elo. Elo ratings offer a standardized method to compare players' proficiency, dynamically updating based on their game outcomes. By analyzing the correlation between players' ages and their Elo ratings, we can gain valuable insights into how age impacts performance, identifying trends such as peak performance ages and the typical career lifespan of top players."
